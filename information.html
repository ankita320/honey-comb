    <h2 class= "ws">Importance of Diversity</h2>
    <img src= "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/588ac0a203596e505dfb39d8/1491597372306-4AV319JUU51WRN7W7PR5/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kA47qaxzGU3oa60Mv3IrElh7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0hGaawTDWlunVGEFKwsEdnE_ZbuhWuTjDl9Hn0Vaidb23CyzgPgNZ_l0zINYXrCLdg/PCM_Diversity" height= "200px">
    <p> When talking about diversifying STEM fields, women, certain minority groups, and people with disabilities are the ones that need more representation in these fields. Diversity brings new perspectives, ideas, and experiences in the workplace. People can learn from one another in alternative ways and enhance their problem-solving in a more efficient matter. Diverse teams open the room for more discussion in regards to creating innovations that will impact everyone in society. Furthermore, it promotes more creativity that can only happen if every race/ethnicity, gender, disability status, nationality, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic background is included in STEM. STEM relies on the creativity, passion, and representation of the people. Without diversity, that is not possible.

    <h2 class= "w0">Issues Regarding the Lack of Resources</h2>
    <img src= "www.PNG" height= "200px">
    <p class= "text">The root of the issue here is that there is an immense lack of early STEM exposure and encouragement for female students from K-12 and college. Because they are not receiving enough STEM experience early on they are less likely to pursue STEM interests throughout their academic careers. According to the National Center For Education Statistics when comparing the STEM degrees of men to women, women are drastically underrepresented by 3:1. This goes to show the male dominated workforce that makes up the majority of STEM. And in order to inspire the future of women in STEM, girls should be exposed to resources like the ones on HoneyComb.

    <p>So what is the next step now for the tech field? Well, there needs to be brought more awareness to the situation. Awareness is key in making change. It is the first step. The more people that know and do something about it, the better. This isn't an ability issue where women don't know how to code or do STEM related things. Women do know how to do these things, but sometimes they are afraid of how it will be like in the tech industry. Because it is such a male dominated field, women may not feel that 'safe environment'. Thus, the tech industry should start hiring much more women. The more women there are, the better it is in terms of diversity and safety. Companies need to all start doing this, one after the other. Hopefully, as a reult from doing this,the percentage of women will rise much more, they will get more leadership positions, and they will feel like they are in a safer and comfortable environment.</p>
